Welcome to my blog!

I am a graduate student at USTC, one of the leading institutions in technology in China. My interests lie in computer graphics, audio, video, and streaming media.

Currently, I am working on the OpenHarmony project with my primary focus on the development of a multimedia camera framework. As a steadfast and passionate learner, I find myself constantly exposed to new technologies, mastering them, and applying these learnings to my daily research work.

Recently, I have plunged myself into learning FFmpeg, a widely recognised and comprehensive open-source tool used for handling multimedia data. It has proven capabilities in dealing with a gamut of media types, including audio and video. It is also used for various purposes like transcoding, streaming, and more. I am driven to understand and master its robust functionalities, and believe it will be a cornerstone for my exploration in the audio and video processing industry.

Through this blog, I aim to share my experiences and insights that I accumulate during my research and learning journey. It is a platform for me to engage with my readers and learn in unison. Stay tuned as I share fascinating knowledge and the latest updates about audio, video processing, and streaming media technologies. I eagerly await your active participation and feedback.
